"""
Assignment: Solve a Maze using Dijkstra's Algorithm

Objective:
In this assignment, you will implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a maze represented as an RGB image.
You will write custom data structures, including a PixelNode class and a priority queue, while ensuring efficient pathfinding.

Problem Description:
You are given an RGB image of a maze where:
- White pixels (all channels â‰ˆ 255) represent valid paths.
- Non-white pixels (one or more channels < 255) represent obstacles.

Your goal is to find the shortest path between a start pixel and an end pixel, given their coordinates, by:
1. Converting the RGB maze image to a grayscale representation for simplicity.
2. Implementing a custom PixelNode class for maze pixels.
3. Building and utilizing a priority queue with a decrease_key operation for efficient pathfinding.
4. Using Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse the maze and determine the shortest path.

Tasks:

1. Grayscale Conversion
Write a function to convert the RGB maze image into grayscale using the formula:
  Gray = 0.2989 * R + 0.5870 * G + 0.1140 * B

Task:
Implement a function `convert_to_grayscale(image)` that:
- Takes the RGB image as input.
- Converts it to grayscale using the formula.
- Returns the grayscale image as a 2D array.

2. Pixel Representation
Create a class `PixelNode` to represent each pixel in the maze. It should include:
- x and y: Coordinates of the pixel.
- distance: Shortest known distance from the start pixel (initialize to infinity).
- visited: Boolean indicating whether the pixel has been processed.
- color: Optional attribute for the grayscale intensity value.
- heap_index: The index of the PixelNode in the priority queue. This is essential for efficient decrease_key operations.

Additionally:
- Implement comparison operators (e.g., __lt__) to make PixelNode objects compatible with a min-heap.

"""


class PixelNode:
    def __init__(self, x, y, distance=float('inf')):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.distance = distance
        self.visited = False
        self.heap_index = None
        self.prev = None

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.distance < other.distance

    def distance_to(self, other):
        return ((self.x - other.x) ** 2 + (self.y - other.y) ** 2) ** 0.5

"""
3. Priority Queue
Write a class `PriorityQueue` for managing PixelNode objects. Use a min-heap for efficient operations. Include the following methods:
- insert(node): Add a new PixelNode to the queue and update its heap_index.
- extract_min(): Remove and return the PixelNode with the smallest distance while maintaining the heap property.
- decrease_key(node, new_distance): Update the distance of an existing node and adjust its position in the heap. Update its heap_index.

Hint:
Use the heap_index attribute of PixelNode objects to keep track of their position in the heap. This allows decrease_key to access nodes efficiently.
